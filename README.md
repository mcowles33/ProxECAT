# type1_error
Type I error rates are calculated for rare variant association tests

This script calculates the type I error rate for 3 methods: ProxECAT, logistic regression, and Poisson regression. 
It takes legend, count, sample, and haplotype files generated by Hapgen2/RAREsim and outputs a table of type I error rates per method by gene. The simulation scenario used here is simulated under the null hypothesis and consists of 1,000 cases, 1,000 internal controls, and two sets of 10,000 external controls.
